\title{
Hodges-Lehmann Cumulative Sum
}
\description{
Computes the test trajectory for the Hodges-Lehmann change point test. See Dehling et al. (2015) for details.
}

\usage{
strucchange.HL(x, varmethod = c("window", "acf", "acfextra"), 
    overlapping = TRUE, shiftcorrect = TRUE, borderN = 10, ...)
}

\arguments{
	\item{x}{univariate numeric vector or time series object.}
	\item{varmethod}{character string defining the estimator of the long run variance. Must be one of 'window', 'acf' or 'acfextra', see Details.}
	\item{overlapping}{logical indicating whether block sums should be distinct or overlapping. Only relevant if \code{varmethod == "window"}, see Details.}
	\item{shiftcorrect}{logical, if TRUE the estimation of the long run variance considers a change in location by first estimating the change point and then subtracting the estimated jump height from the second part of the time series}
	\item{borderN}{numeric, if \code{shiftcorrect == TRUE} the change point for the estimation of the long run variance is not searched below the first and last \code{borderN} observations.}
	\item{...}{further arguments passed to the respective internal functions.}

\details{
The Hodges-Lehmann change point test is a robust and nonparametric test against a change in location under short range dependence. It is preferable to the usual cusum test if the time series contains outliers or has heavy tails. See Dehling et al. (2015) for details. This function computes the test trajectory, which is basically a series of two sample tests, splitting the time series at every possible change-point. The actual test is executed by the function \code{\link{rob.change}}. 

The long run variance of the test statistic consists of two parts, the long run variance of the ranks of the time series \eqn{\sigma}{sigma} and the density at 0 of the difference of two independent random variables which have the same marginal distribution as an observation of the time series \eqn{u(0)}. There are several possibilities to estimate both. For the long run variance of the ranks \eqn{\sigma}{sigma} there are three options. 

If 'varmethod' is 'window' one uses a subsampling estimator, which is based on centered absolute moments of block sums. One can either use distinct blocks, which was proposed by Carlstein (1986) and is applied if one sets \code{"overlapping=FALSE"} or overlapping blocks, which was proposed by Peligrad and Shao (1995) and is applied in case of \code{"overlapping=TRUE"}. For more details how to set the block length and other tuning possibilities, see the help page of \code{\link{asymvar.window}}.

if 'varmethod' is 'acf' one uses a kernel estimator, which weights estimated autocovariances. For more details how to set the bandwidth and other tuning possibilities, see the help page of \code{\link{asymvar.acf}}.

if 'varmethod' is 'acfextra' one uses an extrapolation of the acf based on an AR fit. For more details how to set the bandwidth and other tuning possibilities, see the help page of \code{\link{asymvar.acfextra}}.

To estimate \eqn{u(0)} a classical kernel estimator is used, in fact the function \code{\link{density}} of the stats package. There are several possibilities of differences to use. See the help page of \code{\link{densdiff}} for more details. 

Note that the procedure is computational demanding and can take some time for long time series (with more than 2000 observations).
