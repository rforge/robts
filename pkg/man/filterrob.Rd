\title{
Robustly Filtered Time Series
}
\description{
Filters a given time series robustly. The filtered series can be applied to improve estimations. Optionally, the coefficients of a fitted AR model can be used.  See chapter 8.6 of Maronna et al. (2006) and \enc{D端rre}{Duerre} et al. (2014) for details.
}
\usage{
filterrob(x, filter = NULL, method = c("direct", "ar"), 
    p = 0, na.action = na.fail, psi.l = 2, psi.0 = 3)
}

\arguments{
	\item{x}{numeric vector of a univariate time series.}
	\item{filter}{numeric vector AR coefficients if \code{method == "ar"}.}
	\item{method}{character string whether the filtering is performed directly or using model coefficients calculated previously.}
	\item{p}{order of AR model if \code{method == "direct"}.}
	\item{na.action}{function to be called to handle missing values.}
	\item{psi.l}{numeric value determining the used psi function, see details.}
	\item{psi.0}{numeric value determining the used psi function, see details.}
}

\details{
This function filters a time series in respect of outliers. It is assumed that the time series follows an AR-process with gaussian innovations. If one knows the model, one can determine the AR coefficients by the argument \code{filter} and set \code{method="ar"}. If one does not know the coefficients, but at least the model order \code{p}, one has to set \code{method="direct"}. In this case the parameter are estimated by the robust filter algorithm, see the help page of \code{\link{ARfilter}} for details. If one does not know the order, one should use the function \code{arrob} which determines the model order by an AIC criterion.

Based on the model, residuals are calculated and smoothed by a psi-function, which is the identity for absolute values smaller than \code{psi.l} and 0 for absolute values larger than \code{psi.0}. See \enc{D端rre}{Duerre} et al. (2014) for a formal definition of the psi function. 

Note that this function can be also used to handle missing values. If one replaces missing values with unusual high ones, the algorithm will replace them by the best linear prediction.
