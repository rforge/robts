\title{
Robust Autocorrelation Estimation Based on Median Correlation
}

\description{
Robustly estimates the autocorrelation function of a time series based on the median correlation. See Chakhchoukh (2010) for details.

This function is intended for internal usage only. Users should rather use the wrapper function \code{\link{acfrob}} with argument \code{approach = "acfmedian"}.
}

\usage{
acfrob.median(x, lag.max, biascorr = TRUE)
}

\arguments{
	\item{x}{univariate numeric vector or time series object.}
	\item{lag.max}{integer value giving the maximum lag at which to calculate the acf.}
	\item{biascorr}{logical indicating whether a bias correction of the result should be done. Note that this bias correction is only valid for Gaussian processes.}
}

\value{
A named list of the following elements:

\item{acfvalues}{Numeric vector of estimated autocorrelations at the lags 1,...,\code{lag.max}.}
\item{are}{numeric value giving the asymptotic relative efficiency (ARE) of the estimator as compared to the classical nonrobust estimator, under the assumption that the observations are uncorrelated and from a Gaussian distribution. The ARE is currently not available for this estimation approach and is therefore \code{NA}.}
}

\details{
This function estimates the autocorrelation function based on the median correlation, which is proposed by Chakhchoukh (2010). The acf is estimated for each lag individually. Let \eqn{X} denote the original time series and \eqn{Y} the lagged one, then the autocorrelation is estimated by
\deqn{median(XY)/median(X^2).}
The resulting value does not measure the usual autocorrelation. Therefore a nonlinear transformation based on a Monte Carlo simulation is applied, which is only valid for Gaussian processes.
