\title{
Reweighted Variant of the Robust Scale Estimator Qn
}
\description{
Computes a reweighted variant of the robust scale estimator Qn.
}

\usage{
reweightedQn(x, boundq = 0.999)
}

\arguments{
	\item{x}{numeric vector of observations.}
	\item{boundq}{numeric value specifying the quantile of the chi square distribution for the reweighting step, see Details.}
}

\details{
In a first step the ordinary Qn estimator is computed. In a second step the empirical standard deviation is computed using all observation which are lower than the \code{boundq} quantile of a chi square distribution with one degree of freedom. This additional reweighting step improves the efficiency as compared to the ordinary Qn estimator, which was introduced by Ma and Genton (2001).
}

\value{
Numeric value with the estimated scale.
