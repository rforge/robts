\title{
Robust Autocorrelation Estimation Based on the Gnanadesikan Kettenring Approach
}

\description{
Robustly estimates the autocorrelation function (acf) of a time series based on Gnanadesikan Kettenring (GK) estimators. See Ma and Genton (2000) for details.

This function is intended for internal usage only. Users should rather use the wrapper function \code{\link{acfrob}} with argument \code{approach = "acfGK"}.
}

\usage{
acfrob.GK(x, lag.max, scalefn = Qn, ...)
}

\arguments{
	\item{x}{univariate numeric vector or time series object.}
	\item{lag.max}{integer value giving the maximum lag at which to calculate the acf.}
	\item{scalefn}{function which calculates a scale estimator. Its first argument must be a vector of the data. One could for example use one of the functions \code{\link{Qn}} (the default), \code{\link{Sn}}, \code{\link{scaleTau2}} (all from the package \code{robustbase}), \code{\link{mad}} or (not robust) \code{\link{sd}}.}
	\item{...}{further arguments passed to the function \code{scalefn}.}
}

\value{
A named list of the following elements:

\item{acfvalues}{Numeric vector of estimated autocorrelations at the lags 1,...,\code{lag.max}.}
\item{are}{numeric value giving the asymptotic relative efficiency (ARE) of the estimator as compared to the classical nonrobust estimator, under the assumption that the observations are uncorrelated and from a Gaussian distribution.}
}

\details{
This function estimates the autocorrelation function based on the GK approach, which was proposed by Ma and Genton (2000). The acf is estimated for each lag individually. Let \eqn{X} denote the original time series and \eqn{Y} the lagged one, then the autocorrelation is estimated by
\deqn{\frac{\hat{\sigma}(X+Y)^2-\hat{\sigma}(X-Y)^2}{\hat{\sigma}(X+Y)^2+\hat{\sigma}(X-Y)^2}.}
If one uses the empirical standard deviation as the scale estimator \eqn{\hat{\sigma}}, one roughly gets the usual empirical acf.

There are several possible scale estimators available. The argument \code{scalefn} specifies which estimator is to be used, where \code{scalefn = Qn} is the default. One could for example choose one of the following estimators.

\describe{
\item{\code{Qn}}{The Qn is used, which was proposed by Rousseeuw and Croux (1993). The estimator is known to be very robust and also rather efficient under normality. See the help page of \code{\link{Qn}} in the package \code{robustbase} for details.}
	
\item{\code{scaleTau2}}{The \eqn{\tau} estimator of scale is used, which was proposed by Maronna and Zamar (2002). The estimator is also known to be robust and rather efficient under normality. The estimator includes two tuning parameters, which can be changed using the \code{...} argument. See the help page of \code{\link{scaleTau2}} in the package \code{robustbase} for more details.}
	
\item{\code{mad}}{One uses the usual median absolute deviation, which is known to be very robust and fast to compute, but not very efficient under normality. For more details see the help page of \code{\link{mad}} in the package \code{stats}.}

\item{\code{reweightedQn}}{One uses an efficiently reweighted Qn. For more details see the help page of \code{\link{reweightedQn}}.}
